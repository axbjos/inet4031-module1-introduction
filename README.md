# INET 4031 Module 1 - Introduction

## Introductory concepts in Server Systems and Cloud Computing.

Before we get too far into the concepts of Servers and Cloud Computing we need to get familiar with some of the "tools of the trade."

While Server and Cloud Administrators are not code developers, they use a lot of the same tools.  It is important to have in-depth experience with tools such as:

- Code Editors
- Source Code Version Control Systems (aka Git and GitHub)
- Command Line

Rather than end-user application code, administrators work with artifacts such as configuration files, automated workflows, and command line scripts.  In modern administration these things are treated like code.  Modern IT is a highly automateed environment in which sophisticated, and yes, complex tools are used to ensure applications are running, highly available, and regulary updated with enhancements and bug fixes.

As such, Server and Cloud Administrators also need to have an understanding of various frameworks and architectures used in modern applications.  We will only scratch the surface of these things in this course.

- Dynamic Web Applications
- Event Driven Application Architectures
- Edge vs. Cloud Computing
